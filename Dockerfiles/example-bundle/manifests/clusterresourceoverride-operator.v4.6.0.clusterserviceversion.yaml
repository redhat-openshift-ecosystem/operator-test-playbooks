  description: "ClusterResourceOverride\n==============\n\nContainers can specify compute resource requests and\
     \ limits. Requests are used for scheduling your container and provide a minimum service guarantee. Limits constrain\
     \ the amount of compute resource that may be consumed on your node.\n\nThe scheduler attempts to optimize the compute\
     \ resource use across all nodes in your cluster. It places pods onto specific nodes, taking the pods' compute\
     \ resource requests and nodes' available capacity into consideration.\n\nRequests and limits enable administrators\
     \ to allow and manage the overcommitment of resources on a node, which may be desirable in development environments\
     \ where a trade off of guaranteed performance for capacity is acceptable.\n\n### Requests and Limits\n\nFor each compute\
     \ resource, a container may specify a resource request and limit. Scheduling decisions are made based on the request\
     \ to ensure that a node has enough capacity available to meet the requested value. If a container specifies limits,\
     \ but omits requests, the requests are defaulted to the limits. A container is not able to exceed the specified\
     \ limit on the node.\n\nThe enforcement of limits is dependent upon the compute resource type. If a container makes\
     \ no request or limit, the container is scheduled to a node with no resource guarantees. In practice, the container\
     \ is able to consume as much of the specified resource as is available with the lowest local priority. In low resource\
     \ situations, containers that specify no resource requests are given the lowest quality of\
     \ service.\n\n### Compute Resources\n\nThe node-enforced behavior for compute resources is specific\
     \ to the resource type.\n\n#### CPU\n\nA container is guaranteed the amount of CPU it requests and is additionally\
     \ able to consume excess CPU available on the node, up to any limit specified by the container.\
     \ If multiple containers are attempting to use excess CPU, CPU time is distributed based on the amount\
     \ of CPU requested by each container.\n\nFor example, if one container requested 500m of CPU time and another container\
     \ requested 250m of CPU time, then any extra CPU time available on the node is distributed among the containers\
     \ in a 2:1 ratio. If a container specified a limit, it will be throttled not to use more CPU than the\
     \ specified limit.\n\nCPU requests are enforced using the CFS shares support in the Linux kernel.\
     \ By default, CPU limits are enforced using the CFS quota support in the Linux kernel over a\
     \ 100ms measuring interval, though this can be disabled.\n\n#### Memory\n\nA container is guaranteed\
     \ the amount of memory it requests. A container may use more memory than requested, but once it exceeds\
     \ its requested amount, it could be killed in a low memory situation on the node.\n\nIf a container uses less memory\
     \ than requested, it will not be killed unless system tasks or daemons need more memory than was accounted\
     \ for in the node’s resource reservation. If a container specifies a limit on memory,\
     \ it is immediately killed if it exceeds the limit amount.\n\n### Configuring the Cluster for Overcommitment\n\nScheduling\
     \ is based on resources requested, while quota and hard limits refer to resource limits, which can be set higher than requested\
     \ resources. The difference between request and limit determines the level of overcommit; for instance,\
     \ if a container is given a memory request of 1Gi and a memory limit of 2Gi, it is scheduled based on\
     \ the 1Gi request being available on the node, but could use up to 2Gi; so it is 200% overcommitted.\
     \ If OpenShift Container Platform administrators would like to control the level of overcommit and manage\
     \ container density on nodes, ClusterResourceOverride Admission Webhook can be configured to override\
     \ the ratio between request and limit set on developer containers. In conjunction with a per-project LimitRange\
     \ specifying limits and defaults, this adjusts the container limit and request to achieve the desired level\
     \ of overcommit.\n\nThis requires creating a custom resource of `ClusterResourceOverride` type as in the following\
     \ example:\n\n    \n    - apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1\n    - kind: ClusterResourceOverride\n    - metadata:\n    -   name: cluster\n    - spec:\n    -   podResourceOverride:\n    -     spec:\n    -       memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 25\n    -       cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25\n    -       limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200\n    \n\
     \ **memoryRequestToLimitPercent**: (optional, 1-100) If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted,\
     \ the memory request is overridden to this percentage of the limit.\n\n\
     \ **cpuRequestToLimitPercent**: (optional, 1-100) If a container CPU limit has been specified or defaulted,\
     \ the CPU request is overridden to this percentage of the limit.\n\n\
     \ **limitCPUToMemoryPercent**: (optional, positive integer) If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted,\
     \ the CPU limit is overridden to a percentage of the memory limit, with a 100 percentage scaling 1Gi of RAM to equal 1 CPU\
     \ core. This is processed prior to overriding CPU request (if configured).\n\n\
     \ Note that these overrides have no effect if no limits have been set on containers. [Create a LimitRange object]\
     \ (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/admin_guide/limits.html#admin-guide-limits) with default limits\
     \ (per individual project, or in the [project template](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/admin_guide/managing_projects.html#modifying-the-template-for-new-projects))\
     \ in order to ensure that the overrides apply.\n\nWhen configured, overrides can be enabled per-project by applying the following\
     \ label.\n    ```\n    clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: \"true\"\n    ```\n\n"
